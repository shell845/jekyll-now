## Behavioral Interview

### 1. How to organize answers
* **STAR**: Situation → Task → Action → Result

* **SWOT**: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats

### 2. How to talk about projects

Include process, domain, structure/tools in your answer.

1. Project background (1 min - you should have an overview of the full picture):

e.g. the project is to build a system: 
1. system purpose; 
2. data volume and user numbers of the system; 
3. overview of infrastructure design (e.g the infra is web server  → MQ → app server → DB, how the design achieve high available and scaling etc);

5. Project and performance evaluation (users, managements, teammates) (1 min)
6. Ask interviewers if any specific parts they want to know more
